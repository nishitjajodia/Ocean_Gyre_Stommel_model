Done in partial fulfillment of MTMW14- Numerical Modelling of Atmosphere and Oceans (Project 2) at the University of Reading, Department of Meteorology.

In this project I have attempted to recreat the results obtained by Stommel (1948), by implementing a dynamical models of ocean circulation, in a homogeneous rectangular system, driven by wind-stress, linear bottom drag, pressure gradient forces generated due to differences in surface height and coriolis force. I have used an analytical solution proposed by Mushgrave (1985), a forward-backward scheme as given by Matsuno (1966) and Beckers and Deleersnijder (1993) and a 4th order Runge-Kutta scheme.

# Implmentation
Execute the code in file project2.ipynb to generate all plots and the report.

Constants.py, funcs.py,TimeSchemes.py, Initialize.py, report_funcs.py and Screenshot 2024-04-11 142035.png need to be in the same folder but do not need to be executed.

Final report in pdf format is project2_final.pdf
